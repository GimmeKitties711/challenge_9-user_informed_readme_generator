## Description
In life, there are a lot of things to keep track of. We have several apps to help us write down our responsibilities. We have calendar apps to help us keep track of important events, and we also have notetaking apps to help us write down reminders or information that doesn't necessarily have to be saved as a formal event. The Note Taker app allows you to write and save notes so you can keep track of important information, and you can delete notes once you don't need them anymore. I learned how to write get, post, and delete routes; use functions from the FileSystem module to interact with a JSON file; and add new parameters to objects.

## Installation
No installation is required for this project.

## Usage
The application starts from the home page. Clicking on the "Get Started" button takes you to the notes page. The left side shows all the notes that you have saved, and clicking on a note displays its contents on the right side. In the navigation bar at the top, clicking on "Note Taker" at the top left brings you back to the home page, and clicking the '+' sign displays a blank note template on the right side where you can write a new note. Once the note has a title and body text, a save button appears and your newest note is saved at the bottom of the group of save notes on the left. Each note has a red trash can icon next to it, and clicking on it deletes the note. <br><br> The following images show the application's appearance: <br>(picture) <br>(picture) <br>picture

## Contributing
There are two functionalities I can think of that are not present in this project at the moment:<br><br> 1. Notes cannot be edited.<br> 2. The order of notes in the left-hand column cannot be rearranged.<br> If anyone would like to add, or help me add, those features, I would greatly appreciate it.
