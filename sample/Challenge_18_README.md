## Description
Social media is a huge part of most people's lives, more so than ever before.  The systems that power the most popular sites have to store and manage an enormous amount of data efficiently. This project explores the technologies that connect users, thoughts, friends, and reactions with each other. The routes for retrieving or changing data can be tested in Insomnia. This project taught me how to use Mongoose to store data in documents, use schemas and virtuals to build models, and connect to an express server using mongoose connection.

## Installation
Open the root directory in the Integrated Terminal: (insert picture of Open in Intergrated Terminal here) Then run (type and enter) `npm install` (show picture of npm install here) once you do that, the following packages will be installed: dotenv @ 16.3.1 express @4.18.2 mongoose @7.6.3

## Usage
A walkthrough video that demonstrates the application can be found [here](insert link thingy here) there are some thingies you have to keep in mind as you test the insomnia routes: Get All Users `http://localhost:3001/api/users` Get User by ID: `http://localhost:3001/api/users/id` Functions the same as Get All Users without the ID Create New User: `http://localhost:3001/api/users/` 1. Any text that contains a backslash or double quote must be excaped by an additional backslash. See the Usage section of Challenge 13 readme(linikg thingy here) for details. 2. You are required to enter both a username and an email for your new user to be accepted. Leaving out either field will result in validation errors (insert picture for correct and insert picture for error if I have it. Update User by ID: `http://localhost:3001/api/users` the body of the request, if it is empty or no body, the user will not undergo any changes (api/users/id). However, if you do decide to make changes, you do not have to change both fields. You can choose to change only one of themDelete User by ID `http://localhost:3001/api/users/id` deleting a user by id will cause update and get user by id to fail Add friend by ID `http://localhost:3001/api/usrss/userId/friends/friendId` the user associated with userId adds the user associated with thefriendId. You are allowed to add friends whose ids don't exist (like changing a few characters in a user's id) however it is not recommended to do this as no actual user is tied to the mutilated id and it woud cause confusioning.Delete Friend by ID `http://localhost:3001/api/users/userId/friends/friendId` opposite to Add Friend by ID removes a friends from userId's friends array. (DONT FORGET TO MENTION HOW YOU CAN"T ADD THE SAME USER TWICE) GET ALL THOUGHTS `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts` Get Thought by ID `https://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/id` functions the same as Get Thought by ID without the /id thingy at the end. Create New Thought `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts` required: { thoughtText, username, userId } thoughtText is required to be between 1 and 280 characters (causes an error if 0 or 281 characters) The username you enter can actually be different from the username attached to the userId because even though you write the thoughts under a different username they are attahced to the username associated with the userId. (pictures maybe)? just like p9osting a new user, if you leave fields out it will cause errors Update thought by ID (maybe don't mention the post thingy and put thingy we did for users?) When you update the thought text you can change two things: (also for the get thought by id thingy) the thoughtText and the username. you are free to change either or both of them, and the thought after the changes will show in the result of a successfully request Delet thought by ID: `http://lcoalhost:3001/api/thoughuts/thoughtId ` reactionBody has a char limit of 1-280 just like thoughtText, and in addition you are required to enter a username to indicate who made the reaction. `Delete reaction by ID` unlike create new reaction, delte reaction by id `http://lcoaltnhost:3001/api/thoughts/thoughtId/reactions/reactionId` requires both a toughtId and a reactionId. Bascally it will remove the reaction specified by reactionId from the thought associated iwth thoughtId's reaction array.

## Credits
I forgot to mention in the last part that if you try to delete a reaction that does not exist the thought's reactions array stays the same but if you try to delete a thought that doesn't exist it throws an error, same for users. Received assistance from Robbert Wijtman insteructor in the *#02-ask-the-class* Slack channel. Also receied assitance from AskBCS assistants Joem, Zack, and Shaun. The following web resources helped me write the code for this project: (insert web resources here)
