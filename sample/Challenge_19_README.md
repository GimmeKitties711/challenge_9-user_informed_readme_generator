## Description
In Challenge 11, the task was to create a notetaking application where the user could create new notes, save them, and delete them once they were no longer needed. However, one limitation of this application was that it did not function offline. The user should still be able to take notes even without an internet connection. This application works offline, auto saves every time the user clicks off of the text window, and can be installed on the user's computer. I learned how to use webpack to build an application, make an app installable, and modify the contents of a database.

## Installation
No installation is required for this project; however, you can click the 'Install!' button in the top left corner to install the app on your computer: (picture)

## Usage
The text editor starts with no text except the JATE (Just Another Text Editor) logo when loaded up: (picture of starting page) After writing your own text, the new content is saved when you click off the window (anywhere outside of the writing area) (picture of console message the window has lost focus here) **Important:** You must click off the window for the content to be saved. If you write new text then refresh or close the tab without clicking off the window first, your newest changes will be lost (browser only). You can also turn off the wifi and your changes are still saved. The following pictures show the application tab of the devtools thingy: (picture of manifest) (picture of service worker) (picture of indexeddb > jate > jate) Maybe something about the phone installation?
