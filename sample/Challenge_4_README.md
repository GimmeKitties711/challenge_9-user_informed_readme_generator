## Description
When you are learning a new skill, it is important to test your knowledge with questions about fundamental concepts. Doing so will help solidify the ideas in your mind and make you more familiar with the topic as a whole. This quiz tests your JavaScript knowledge by asking you 10 questions about methods and concepts you are likely to see and use. After you completed the quiz, you can choose to save your score, which is higher the faster you complete the quiz and the fewer mistakes you make. This project taught me how to use setInterval() and setTimeout(), display only a certain part of the page, and iterate through localStorage to find certain data.

No installation is required for this project.

## Usage
Starting from the home page, you are provided with instructions on how to complete the quiz. From there, you can either view high scores, as shown in the header, or start the quiz: (insert picture of home page here) Once you start the quiz, you can view the high scores while the quiz is in progress and it pauses the timer: (insert picture of view high scores pauses quiz hover button here) (insert picture of high scores from quiz here) If you answer a question correctly, the result will show as correct as show here (insert picture of correct status here) If you answer a question incorrectly, the status will show as 'Incorrect. You have lost 5 seconds.' (insert picture of incorrect status here) Once you have completed the quiz, you will see the results screen (insert picture of quiz completed container here). from there, you can choose whether or not you want to save your latest score. If you choose not to save your score, you will be taken to the high scores page, from which you can go back to the home page. If you choose to save your score, however, you will be presented with a form where you can enter your initials (insert form picture here) which will then take you to the high scores page (insert picture of high scores page here) **Important:** If you choose to save your high score but it is not in the top 10 saved scores, it will not show on the high scores page. **Important:** if you say yes when asked if you want to save your score and then change your mind, you can get back to the home page by clicking 'View high scores' in the header.

## Credits

## Contributing
This project does not yet have the functionality to delete a specific high score and have the new top 10 scores reloaded with every deletion. If someone could help me implement this feature, that would be greatly appreciated.
